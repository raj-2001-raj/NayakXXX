## 🚲 Project Overview

**Best Bike Paths (BBP)** is a software system designed to support cyclists by creating and browsing an inventory of bike paths. Unlike standard navigation apps that prioritize distance, BBP prioritizes safety and path status.

### Project Scope
This project covers the following functionalities:
1.  **Trip Recording:** Recording personal trips and calculating statistics (distance, speed, etc.).
2.  **Manual Reporting:** Inserting publishable information about path status manually.
3.  **Visualization:** Visualizing paths between an origin and destination based on path scores.
4.  **Automated Data Collection:** Acquiring data from mobile sensors (accelerometer/gyroscope) to detect anomalies.
5.  **Verification Protocol:** A confirmation mechanism where users must verify automated detections to prevent false positives.
